# Task-1-Perform-Basic-Mathematical-Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.


In first and the second line inputs are asked from the users
In 3rd and 4th line we turned it to int data type as by default they input data type is string. It is needed for the basic mathematic operations.
5th line a variable named "Addition" is assigned to addition operation.
6th line a variable named "Substraction" is assigned to Substraction operation.
7th line a variable named "Multiplication" is assigned to Multiplication operation.
8th line a variable named "Division" is assigned to division operation.
9th and 10th line print command used with blank to use 2 blank row for preferred output.
11th to 14th line used print command to print the results of addition, substraction, multiplication and division respectively with the directed text output.
